"""
Write an efficient algorithm that searches for a value in an m x n matrix. This matrix has the following properties:

	Integers in each row are sorted in ascending from left to right.
	Integers in each column are sorted in ascending from top to bottom.

Example:

Consider the following matrix:

[
  [1,   4,  7, 11, 15],
  [2,   5,  8, 12, 19],
  [3,   6,  9, 16, 22],
  [10, 13, 14, 17, 24],
  [18, 21, 23, 26, 30]
]

Given target = 5, return true.

Given target = 20, return false.
